## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Git Branch Strategy
Our project uses a structured branching model for organized development:

```bash
# Main branches
main                        # Production-ready code
develop                     # Integration branch for features

# Feature branches (completed)
feature/frontend-design     # UI/UX implementation and CSS system
feature/react-functionality # React components and JavaScript logic
feature/dependencies       # Package installation and setup

# Future branches (examples)
feature/authentication      # Enhanced auth features
feature/dashboard-improvements # Dashboard enhancements
hotfix/critical-bug        # Emergency fixes
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build        # Create production build
npm run preview      # Preview production build locally
npm run lint         # Run ESLint for code quality

# Git workflow
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
git add .
git commit -m \"feat: descriptive commit message\"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Code Standards & Best Practices
- **ES6+ JavaScript** with modern syntax and features
- **Functional Components** with React Hooks
- **CSS Custom Properties** for consistent theming
- **Semantic HTML** elements for accessibility
- **JSDoc Comments** for comprehensive documentation
- **Consistent Naming**: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch blocks and error boundaries

## 📱 Responsive Design System

### Mobile-First Approach
```css
/* Breakpoint System */
/* Mobile: Default styles (0px and up) */
@media (max-width: 480px)  { /* Small mobile adjustments */ }
@media (max-width: 768px)  { /* Tablet portrait */ }
@media (max-width: 1024px) { /* Tablet landscape / Small desktop */ }
@media (max-width: 1440px) { /* Standard desktop */ }
```

### Design System Components
- **Color Palette**: Primary (Blue), Secondary (Gray), Success (Green), Warning (Orange), Error (Red)
- **Typography**: Inter font family with fluid scaling using clamp()
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4px-based spacing scale
- **Shadow System**: Layered depth with 4 shadow levels
- **Border Radius**: Consistent corner rounding system
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions

npx kill-port 5173

# Or start on different port
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

**Styling Issues**
- Verify CSS custom properties are defined in :root
- Check browser developer tools for CSS errors
